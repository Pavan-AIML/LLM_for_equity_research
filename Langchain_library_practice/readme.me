<h1 align = "center"> In this tutorial we will learn about the implementation of the most important library used in LLms.</h1>
<h2 align = "left"> We use lang chain in real world for the following tasks.</h2>
- Chaining the LLMs and Components Together.
- Streamlined Integration of (RAG) Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
- Support for memory enhanced interaction.
- Integration with external tools and APIs.
- Moduler and customizable pipelines.
- Support for multiple LLMs and Vector Databases.
- Allows to connect to your own data to the LLM modle.
- Documents converts to chunks, they are stored in the form of embeddings(vector representation of the text.)
